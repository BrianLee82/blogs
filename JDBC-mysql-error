java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: driverClass

1、I had imported the mysql-connector-java-5.1.38.jar into the IDEA，but the problem sill had.

2、I used the IDEA's DATABASE tools ,it can connect my mysql，but the version of mysql connector is 5.1.46.

3、Maybe the version is wrong.

4、After i downloaded the newest version of mysql-connector-java-5.1.47 and imported ，the test function passed.

Done!!
